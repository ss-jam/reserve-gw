## Reservation gateway improvement project

This project started out as a proof of concept to demonstrate possible improvements
to the online reservation systems of a couple of state parks. Two main goals were to
improve the search capabilty and decrease the time a patron spends obtaining results,
thus reducing his/her frustration level. The reservation systems were to work
transparently as they are and without impact to any development process or flow.

Note: these reservation systems consist of camping and day use sites across the two states,
Tennessee and Texas. During high seasons when lengths of stay at any one camp sight is limited,
patrons try to book multiple camping sights at a location to cover th

#### Improve search capability:
+ Turn from relatively flat results based upon date ranges into multi-varied results of possible combinations over the date ranges;
+ Present the results in a more informative and sortable way to provide all the information available cleanly and quickly;

#### Decrease patron frustration:
+ Learn and maintain user preferneces including favorite camping destinations and camp sites;
+ Provide semi-autonomous search mechanism to find and notify user of locations, dates, and possible combinations;
